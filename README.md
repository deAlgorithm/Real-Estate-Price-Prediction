# Real Estate Price Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting property prices in Manila using Multiple Linear Regression to optimize property valuation. The objective is to enhance accuracy in property valuations amidst market volatility and localized influences.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict property prices using Multiple Linear Regression.
- **Tech Stack:** Microsoft Excel for Descriptive, Diagnostics, and Predictive Analytics.
- **Scope:** Includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Model Development, and Model Evaluation.

## Key Features

- **Data Description:** Includes variables such as Price, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Lot Size, House Size, Garage Spaces, Swimming Pool presence, House Age, and Safety Index.
- **Analysis Tools:** Utilized Microsoft Excel and its Analysis Tool-Pak for model development and evaluation.
- **Insights:** Explored correlations between property features and pricing to create a robust valuation model.

## Project Structure

- **EDA:** Basic data exploration and summary statistics.
- **Model Development:** Multiple Linear Regression model creation and validation.
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics and techniques used to evaluate model performance.
